A golang library (and CLI) to control your Tapo SmartPlugs `P100 / P110` with latest firmware versions

> At this moment, the library is not covering the whole API as it is discovered by reverse engineering
> If you want to cover more things, consider [contributing](#how-to-contribute)

## Motivation

I own several Tapo P100/P110 at home to control some appliances using custom automations 
[for example for the heater](https://github.com/achetronic/autoheater/). 
Honestly, I completely forgot to disable firmware updates, and before [Matter](https://csa-iot.org/all-solutions/matter/) 
disabling updates is almost a requirement as automation manufacturers tends to modify their closed APIs in a way they 
change almost everything from time to time, forcing you to do some reverse engineering.

As you can imagine, this project was created because of that, when some days ago, TPLink decided to switch from 
`securePassthrough` protocol to `KLAP` on `P100 / P110` plugs, and the library I use under the hood [does not seem
to be actively maintained](https://github.com/richardjennings/tapo/issues/4#issuecomment-1840902314), 
so I decided to research and craft a new one on my own.

> This library does not pretend to cover all devices, not even all the protocol versions, but always the latest ones.
> As the project will use releases, you can select which version fit your needs

## Library

```go
    import (
        "github.com/achetronic/tapogo/pkg/tapogo"
        "github.com/achetronic/tapogo/api/types"
    )

    var tapoClient *tapogo.Tapo
    var response   *types.ResponseSpec
    var err error

	tapoClient, err = tapogo.NewTapo("192.168.0.100", "username", "password")
    response, err = tapoClient.TurnOn()
    response, err = tapoClient.TurnOff()
    response, err = tapoClient.GetEnergyUsage()
    response, err = tapoClient.DeviceInfo()
```

## CLI

`go install github.com/achetronic/tapogo`

### Usage
```
tapogo <ip-address> <username> <password> [on, off, energy-usage, device-info]
```

For example:

```
tapogo 192.168.0.100 email@address thepassword energy-usage
{
  "error_code": 0,
  "result": {
    "current_power": 0,
    ...
    "month_energy": 10000,
    "month_runtime": 10000,
    "today_energy": 400,
    "today_runtime": 300
  }
}
```
